Open SS13 SVN Formatting
========================

This one is pretty simple. All contributor made docs should either be txt or PDF. All files within the repository should have Windows style line ending where relevant. A script is provided for linux users, to convert directories to and from Windows line endings.

All things under trunk, branches and tags are governed by the project's file name convention. Everything under contributor-docs should be all lower-case, txt only, with .txt file extension. No adding to management-scripts please! Just chat with me if you wanna add something there.
