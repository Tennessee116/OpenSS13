Open SS13 SVN Structure
=======================

SVN operates a very simple structure.

All main development goes on in the 'trunk' folder. If you need to make a Snapshot (I will, not so sure if you will), then you simply do 'svn mkdir tags/[tag name]' 'svn copy svn://ss13.net/openss13/trunk svn://ss13.net/openss13/tags/[tag name]'. It is important that NO users commit anything inside the tags directory. The main use of tags are for things like releases. Say you wished to release version 1.0, you'd simply do:

svn mkdir tags/release-1.0
svn copy svn://ss13.net/openss13/trunk svn://ss13.net/openss13/tags/release-1.0

If you are seriously worried about anyone making rogue commits, please email me.

If you really need to seriously bug-fix a particular release, even after it's out, then make a branch. Branches are basically the same as tags, except you are allows to commit. In essence, they become mini-SVN repositories themselves. So, to bug-fix release-1.0, simply do:

svn mkdir branches/release-1.0
svn copy svn://ss13.net/openss13/tags/release-1.0 svn://ss13.net/openss13/branches/release-1.0

Then edit and commit away inside branches/release-1.0! When you're ready to release the fixed version, just create a tag called release-1.1, then delete branches/release-1.0. However, this kinda branching should only be done for major bux fixes. If it's a minor problem (in the latest release), then you create a branch just as before, but you won't create a tag when you're done. You'll speak with me, because what you want to do is merge the branch back into the trunk. This is not a fun process, hence I'd rather I helped out with this.

This more or less covers the reasoning behind the general SVN structure. All of the operations described here are pretty major, so if in doubt, chat with me, or even get me to do it.
