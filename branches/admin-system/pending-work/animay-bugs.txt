- Spawned metal from sandbox panel, when deleted (tested using hobnob's debug
verb "delete" and the metal was in my right hand) crashed my localhost
server. With windows debugger coming up, actually.

- Monkies can talk while sleeping(injected with sleep toxins)

- Closet bug is still in your version.

You go into a closet, before it closes click your character and drag it to a
nearby closet, release the mouse button and you'll teleport.

You can do this into walls, get out of locked lockers, and other things.

- In the show panel, toggling player voting on/off produces odd messages.

Example:

Player mode voting toggled to On.
Player mode voting toggled to On.

Seems to just be a display bug.

- Making walls in space removes metal and you get no wall.

This also happens on PS tiles(in 93.2, not sure now)
