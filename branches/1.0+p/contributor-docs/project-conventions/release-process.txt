=== General Release Process ===

The general hope is that the project will have a 2 month release cycle. That is, we should be releasing a new major version every two months. This is obviously slower than other teams, but there is more for us to coordinate. 2 weeks before a release, a branch is formed for the release and is frozen. At this point, no new functionality can be added to that branch, only bug-fixes. After 2 weeks of (hopefully) more intensive testing, a Release Candidate 1 will be released, by the release engineer (Stephen001, at the time of writing). This RC will be hosted on a server and play-tested for a week, with bug fixes being made on the branch (and where relevant, the trunk). This RC approach will be repeated as needed, depending on the core team's confidence in the release. Once all is well, the branch will be copied to the appropriate version tag and the release engineer will do the full release.
